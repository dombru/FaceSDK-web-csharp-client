## Example of Face Matching

Performing request:

```csharp
var face1 = File.ReadAllBytes("face_1.jpg");
var face2 = File.ReadAllBytes("face_2.jpg");

var matchImage1 = new MatchImage(data: face1, type: ImageSource.LIVE);
var matchImage2 = new MatchImage(data: face1, type: ImageSource.DOCUMENT_RFID);
var matchImage3 = new MatchImage(data: face2, type: ImageSource.LIVE);

var matchingRequest = new MatchRequest(
      false, new List<MatchImage> {matchImage1, matchImage2, matchImage3}
);

var matchingResponse = sdk.MatchingApi.Match(matchingRequest);
```

Parsing results:
```csharp
foreach (var comparison in matchingResponse.Results)
   Console.WriteLine("pair({0}, {1}) similarity: {2}",
       comparison.FirstIndex, comparison.SecondIndex, comparison.Similarity);
```
